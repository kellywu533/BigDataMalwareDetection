# Malware Detection

**Project Proposal**   
This project will utilize the AndroZoo dataset taken from Fast & Furious: On the modeling of malware detection as an evolving data stream to analyze whether Android applications are malware or benign. The AndroZoo dataset contains “resources names, source code classes and methods, manifest permissions etc.” This information will help determine various aspects of applications’ behavior based on these attributes, as well as evaluate the purpose of permission requests in regard to potential participation in nefarious activities. Additionally, this dataset can be used to train machine learning models to identify malware. 
  
**Part 1: Proposal, Data Collection, Spark**  
Project Description
This project plans to use Android application data to run big data and machine learning analyses. The goal of this analysis is to identify attributes in an application that indicate whether the application is malicious or benign. In other words, based on an Android appication’s attributes, can machine learning predict whether an app is malicious or non-malicious? This project will use Hadoop and Spark libraries to preprocess the data for machine learning use. Next, this project will use Spark’s machine learning library to create a model that predicts whether or not an application is prone to malware.
Data Description
This project will use the AndrooZoo dataset used in this research paper: Fast & Furious: On the modeling of malware detection as an evolving data stream, retrieved from Kaggle. We will generate a table that includes 20 sample rows of data as well as their columns and give a short explanation for each attribute. Then we will run the code on spark as per the project instructions.
  
**Part 2: Spark Based Analysis**  
This project will use Spark and Hadoop to preprocess the data for cross validation machine learning. Spark and Hadoop allows for data preparation by singling out attributes that will be used to build the machine learning model. Apache Spark libraries can process the data and then store that data in SQL. During this process, the execution time using a varying number of Spark workers and a varying data size will be graphed and evaluated. Next, the project will use a linear support vector machine (linear svc) algorithm to create a model that categorizes entries into malicious and benign. With this information and the AndrooZoo’s provided classifications, we can analyze the accuracy of our model and use the model for future prediction and analysis.
    
**Part 3: Web Interface**  
This project will include a web interface using Github Pages. Github Pages allows for demonstration of this project and an application that can read data from MySQL database. This server will allow for users to input designated application attributes and view results of applications that match those attributes. The web interface will be user friendly and easy to navigate. A map will be made to distinguish between malicious and benign applications. Additionally, a filter option based on specific column attributes will be provided.
